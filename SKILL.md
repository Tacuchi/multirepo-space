name: multirepo-space
description: |
  Scaffold and manage multi-repo workspaces for AI coding agents.
  Delegates to the multirepo-space CLI (bundled). Use when user says
  "create workspace", "setup multirepo", "multi-repo workspace",
  "add repo to workspace", "remove repo from workspace",
  "workspace status", "check workspace health", "init multi-repo",
  "orchestrate repos", "link repositories".
  Also use when user has multiple repos and needs a central
  coordination point for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI).

# multirepo-space

## Quick routing

User intent → Command:
- "Create/scaffold workspace" → `setup`
- "Add a repo" → `add` (verify workspace exists with `status` first)
- "Remove/detach repo" → `remove`
- "Check/verify/health" → `status`
- Single repo project → DO NOT use this Skill
- Monorepo (Nx/Turborepo) → DO NOT use this Skill

## Before running — decision guide

Before executing, think about the workspace design:
- Do these repos share API contracts or interfaces? → they benefit from cross-repo analysis
- Is the workspace inside an existing git repo? → git root symlinks will be needed
- Will multiple workspaces coexist in the same git repo? → prefixed symlinks prevent collisions

Ask the user before executing:
1. Does the workspace directory already exist? If not, create it first (`mkdir`).
2. Is this a NEW workspace or adding to an EXISTING one? → `setup` vs `add`.
3. Are all repo paths absolute? They MUST be absolute — symlinks break with relative paths.
4. First time? Always suggest `--dry-run` so user can preview changes.
5. Does the user need custom model assignments? Default: coordinator=opus, specialist=sonnet.

## Flags — when to use each

| Flag | Use when | Do NOT use when |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `--dry-run` | First run, user not familiar with tool | Re-runs after preview was approved |
| `--yes` | Automated pipelines, user already confirmed in chat | First time, destructive changes |
| `--verbose` | Debugging, verifying stack detection | Normal execution |
| `--model-coordinator=MODEL` | User wants a specific model for the coordinator | Using default (opus) |
| `--model-specialist=MODEL` | User wants a specific model for specialists | Using default (sonnet) |

## If detect_stack returns "Generic"

The CLI creates the specialist agent without verify commands. Ask the user:
"Stack was not auto-detected for [repo]. What is the main language/framework?"
Then manually add verify commands to the generated specialist agent file.

## When NOT to use this

- Single repo projects — no benefit, just overhead.
- True monorepos (one repo, multiple packages) — use monorepo tools (Nx, Turborepo) instead.
- Repos that must stay completely independent — managed blocks modify external repos' AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.

## NEVER

- Run `setup` on a populated workspace without confirming with the user first.
- Use relative paths for repos — symlinks will break when working directory changes.
- Skip `--dry-run` for first-time users — always suggest preview first.
- Assume symlinks always work on Windows — the PowerShell port falls back to junctions when symlinks need elevation, but junctions only support local directories (not network paths).
- Assume workspace exists — verify with `status` before running `add` or `remove`.
- Create the workspace directory inside one of the repos — git root detection will find the repo itself, creating circular symlink references.
- Edit managed blocks manually in external repos — they get overwritten on next `add`/`setup`.
- Run `add` with a repo whose basename matches an existing alias — the previous specialist gets overwritten without warning.
- Modify `settings.json` manually — the CLI expects a specific format and manual edits can break parsing in `add`/`remove`.
- Run `setup`/`add` while another agent is using the workspace — managed blocks and settings can end up in an inconsistent state.

## Detect OS and run

- macOS/Linux/WSL: `bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/multirepo-space" <subcommand> [args]`
- Windows PowerShell: `powershell "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/multirepo-space.ps1" <subcommand> [args]`

Replace `$SKILL_DIR` with the absolute path to this skill's directory.

Templates are in `$SKILL_DIR/templates/` — read them to understand what files get generated (e.g., `workspace-instructions.md.tmpl`, `coordinator.md.tmpl`, `specialist.md.tmpl`).

## Script behavior summary

The scripts (`scripts/multirepo-space` for bash, `scripts/multirepo-space.ps1` for PowerShell) are fully offline — they make NO network requests and do NOT modify system files.

What each subcommand does:
- `setup`: reads repo manifest files (package.json, pom.xml, etc.) to detect tech stacks, then generates `.md` agent files, `.claude/settings.json`, and symlinks inside the workspace directory. Also appends a managed block to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` in each listed repo. If workspace is nested inside a git repo, creates prefixed symlinks in git root for agent discovery. Saves configuration to `.claude/.multirepo-space.conf`.
- `add`: same as setup but for a single repo added to an existing workspace. Loads config from `.multirepo-space.conf` to preserve original model settings.
- `remove`: deletes the specialist agent file and symlink for a repo, removes the managed block from the repo's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, and refreshes git root symlinks.
- `status`: read-only — checks symlink health, agent file parity, config persistence, and git root symlink state. Writes nothing.

All extracted values from repo files are sanitized (length-limited, control characters and injection patterns stripped) before being inserted into templates.

Scope of filesystem writes is limited to:
1. The workspace directory (files it creates)
2. `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` inside each configured repo (managed block only, delimited by `<!-- MULTIREPO_SPACE_MANAGED:START/END -->` markers)
3. Git root `.claude/agents/` and `.agents/` directories (symlinks only, prefixed with `ws-<name>--`)

## Agent hierarchy

```
Coordinator (opus)
├── repo-frontend (sonnet)
└── repo-backend (sonnet)
```

- If the user has created global agents (e.g., architecture, style, code-review), both the coordinator and specialists can invoke them for analysis. These agents are user-managed, read-only, and may not be present in all workspaces.
- Note: the coordinator acts as a contextual guide — it orients the user on which specialist to invoke but does not automatically delegate tasks. Each specialist is invoked directly by the user.

## Claude Code vs Codex compatibility

- `.claude/agents/*.md` → includes YAML frontmatter (name, model, description, tools)
- `.agents/*.md` → plain markdown only, no frontmatter (Codex/Gemini/Cursor compatible)
- Both directories contain identical agent logic, only the frontmatter differs

## After running

- Run `status <workspace_path>` to verify all symlinks are healthy and agents are in parity.
- Check that AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist in both the workspace and each external repo.
- If `setup` failed mid-way, it's safe to re-run — existing files get overwritten.
- To start working: `cd <workspace_path> && claude` or `cd <workspace_path> && codex`.
- If workspace is nested in a git repo, verify git root symlinks with `ls -la <git-root>/.claude/agents/ws-*`.

## Common issues

- **"Workspace path does not exist"**: create directory first, then run `setup`.
- **Broken symlinks after moving repos**: re-run `setup` with updated absolute paths.
- **"Permission denied" on Windows**: run PowerShell as Administrator for symlink creation.
- **Stack not detected**: the CLI falls back to "Generic" — specialist agent still gets created, just without stack-specific verify commands.
- **Agents not discovered in nested workspace**: verify git root symlinks exist. Run `status` to check. Re-run `setup` if symlinks are missing.
- **Partial setup failure** (files created but symlinks missing): re-run `setup` with same args — the script overwrites existing files safely and recreates all symlinks.
